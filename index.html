    <p class="leftline"> Welcome to my Web Developers portfolio! Before learning to create websites, I worked as an archaeologist and then with a nonprofit focused on the rights of immigrants. My background in conservation and aid work now provides my motivation for creating beautiful and effective websites. With each project, I aim to create something that can inform, connect, or explain, and can do it without losing a focus on elegant design.
